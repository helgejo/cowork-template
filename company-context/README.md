# Company Context

This folder is your single source of truth for company-specific knowledge.

## What Goes Here

- **glossary.md** — Definitions of company terms, acronyms, product names, integrations, and internal tools
- **Brand guidelines** — Logo usage, tone, messaging, visual identity
- **Product information** — Product overview, feature descriptions, positioning
- **Team guides** — How decisions are made, who owns what, organizational structure
- **Integration guides** — How to connect with external tools and systems
- **Any other company knowledge** that should be shared with your AI assistant

## How to Organize

Create subfolders as needed for different knowledge domains (e.g., `brand/`, `product/`, `people/`, `processes/`). Keep everything clear and searchable.

## Important Notes

- This is NOT for personal or private information — only shareable company knowledge
- Keep content up-to-date; outdated information is worse than no information
- Use simple, clear language suitable for an AI assistant to reference
- Link to external sources when helpful, but also include summaries in-document
